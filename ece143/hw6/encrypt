def encrypt_message(message,fname):
   '''
       Given `message`, which is a lowercase string without any punctuation, and `fname` which is the
       name of a text file source for the codebook, generate a sequence of 2-tuples that
       represents the `(line number, word number)` of each word in the message. The output is a list
       of 2-tuples for the entire message. Repeated words in the message should not have the same 2-tuple. 
       
       :param message: message to encrypt
      :type message: str
      :param fname: filename for source text
      :type fname: str
      :returns: list of 2-tuples

      Given `inlist`, which is a list of 2-tuples`fname` which is the
      name of a text file source for the codebook, return the encrypted message.
